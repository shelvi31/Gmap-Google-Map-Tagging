gmplot: Plot the GPS Coordinates in your Dataset on Google Maps
I love working with Google Maps data. Think about it – it is one of the most data-rich applications you’ll find anywhere. That’s why I decided to start off with this Python trick.

Scatterplots are excellent when we want to see the relationship between two variables. But will you use them if the variables are the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location? Probably not. It would be best to plot these points on a real map so that we can easily visualize and solve a particular problem (such as optimizing routes).

gmplot provides an amazing interface to generate HTML and JavaScript to render all the data we’d like on top of Google Maps. Let’s see how to use gmplot with an example.
